## Manifiesto Maker

MAKE
Making is fundamental to what it means to be human.
We must make, create, and express ourselves to feel
whole. There is something unique about making
physical things. Things we make are like little pieces
of us and seem to embody portions of our soul.


SHARE
Sharing what you have made and what you know
about making with others is the method by
which a maker’s feeling of wholeness
is achieved. You cannot make and not share.


GIVE
There are few things more selfless and satisfying
than giving away something you have made. The act
of making puts a small piece of you into the object.
Giving it to someone else is like giving that person a
small piece of yourself. Such things are often
the most cherished items we possess.
